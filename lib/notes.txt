You can place shared code into the lib folder.
There's a CSV parser already in here (borrowed from https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse).
Such code can then be included in drivers and user scripts like this:

	const Papa:any = require("lib/papaparse");

or, if you have the a TypeScript definition available, you can type it properly:

	const Papa:PapaParse.Static = require("lib/papaparse");

You can then call it to parse a CSV file like this:

	const result = Papa.parse(fileData, {dynamicTyping: true, header: true});

See the papaparse documentation for details.

Also includes split-string by Jon Schlinkert (https://github.com/jonschlinkert/split-string),
for splitting strings (such as device replies) respecting quotes and escape characters.
